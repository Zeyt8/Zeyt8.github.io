                    Meet characters with their own stories, grievances and quests. When the landslide happened, an evil force awakened.

                    Tales tell of advanced versions of these spells, make your Healing Stones push enemies away from you or make your Water Tide spawn a helping ward. That is if you can find someone willing to teach you.

                <p>
                    My biggest project yet. It is a video game that started as a game for Global Game Jam 2021. The theme was "Lost and found". I had the role of a programmer and the only artist and sound manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to a missunderstanding we were only 2 people in the team, both programmers. We came up with the basic ideea for the game quickly. I thought of choosing cardboard cutouts as our arstyle since that would let me draw the art even though I do not have much exeprience in drawing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game jam took 5 days during which we worked day and night, getting about 4 hours of sleep everyday, just to get by. During the game jam we managed to do the dialogue system, the spells and the first area, much more than we imagined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We overwhelmingly won the popular vote at the end of the event and after receiving positive feedback from the other participants we decided to make a fully-fledged game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the following months, I worked on this project along with my colleague most of the day, eventually releasing it in June of that year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From this project, I gained experience in drawing, sprite integration and layer management, QA, sound manipulation and save/load systems.
                    We integrated the steam interface and achievement API in the game.
